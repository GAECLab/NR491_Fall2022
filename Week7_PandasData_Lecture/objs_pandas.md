The dataset I had in mind for pandas was the census data [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/accessing-census-data-with-python-3e2f2b56e20d) and [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/accessing-census-data-with-python-3e2f2b56e20d).

Some of the things that we'd like to show are importing CSVs, doing some data selection, and plotting time series w pandas. Ideally, we'd download census data for NC and look at socio-economic data per county (e.g., Gini index) and have a little exercise answering a Q such as where are the less privileged areas located in NC? and maybe as a HW Q across the US?
