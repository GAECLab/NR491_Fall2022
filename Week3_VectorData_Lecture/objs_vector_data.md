The first thing would need to be a description of the 3 main types of vector data, point, lines, and polygons, and examples of each that students can visualize first in QGIS and then in python; also explain what a shapefile format is (including the attribute table), introduce the geojson format, and maybe have an example of csv or txt file that has lat long coordinates that need to be imported and made into a shapefile/geojson both in QGIS and python. 

For python we should use geopandas and introduce the library, the concept of geo/dataframes, geometries, extent, coordinate ref systems, and some of the main functions for vector data - gpd.read(), gpd.plot(), .head() and .tail(), .plot(), .geom_type(), .info(), any others? 
We should include info and an example of subsetting data and clipping a shapefile w gpd.clip(), maybe clip counties to NC boundaries. We should also have a section where we plot several types of vector data both in QGIS and in python, for python we should use matplotlib and explain a little bit about how one plots multiple shapefiles; I think we should also introduce folium as I'm assuming students will like that feature.
Â 
As HW for this 1st exercise, we should challenge them to download 3 vector types and plot them on the same map, we give them what the final look of the map should be and ask them based on the info presented in this notebook to plot and get to the same map.
