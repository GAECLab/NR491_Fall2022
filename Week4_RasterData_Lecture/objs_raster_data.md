This notebook should cover raster data and some points for our students to learn:

1. how to open and plot raster data in qgis and python and how to get metadata for raster data, including crs, resolution, extent

2. types of raster data: e.g., continuous data (DEM), classes (lclu) - we should dwl an example of each and add how they should plot the values using histograms, explore min, max values

3. clip raster data to a polygon, so we should clip the 2 examples above to NC?

4. plot raster data, plot both raster and polygons

5. summarize raster values per points

For HW, I'm thinking we should show them how to summarize raster values for a set of points for one raster (e.g. DEM) and ask them to do the same for the lclu raster or vice-versa.
-   Open raster data using Python.
-   Be able to list and identify 3 spatial attributes of a raster dataset: extent, crs and resolution.
-   Explore and plot the distribution of values within a raster using histograms.
-   Access metadata stored in a GeoTIFF raster file via TIF tags in Python.


** Clip for HW, values from points for bonus
