    "\"Continuous data, or a continuous surface, represents phenomena where each location on the surface is a measure of the concentration level or its relationship from a fixed point in space or from an emitting source. Continuous data is also referred to as field, nondiscrete, or surface data. One type of continuous surface data is derived from those characteristics that define a surface where each location is measured from a fixed registration point. These include elevation (the fixed point being sea level) and aspect (the fixed point being direction: north, east, south, and west)\" ([ESRI, 2021](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/extensions/3d-analyst/discrete-and-continuous-data-in-3d-analyst.htm)).\n",
