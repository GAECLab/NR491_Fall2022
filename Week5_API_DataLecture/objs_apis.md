Objectives are to introduce students to interacting w data APIs so I'm thinking of having them dwl USGS stream flow data from a station close to Lake Raleigh and see if there is any correlation between water area in L Raleigh and closest stream flow. The ways I came across to do this in python seem to be [this](https://github.com/USGS-python/dataretrieval) and [this](https://www.earthdatascience.org/tutorials/acquire-and-visualize-usgs-hydrology-data/).
A description on APIs in general and the one used in particular would be helpful. Precipitation data would also be helpful.
