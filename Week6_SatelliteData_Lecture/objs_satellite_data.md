This data lecture should focus on RS data, namely optical multispectral data. I can introduce RS a bit in a lecture style so we don't need to go super deep into it, other then briefly saying what optical data is and that's the most commonly used data type in RS at the moment and make the case that it's raster data but how it's different from the raster data introduced in the previous exercise. Next we should use this opportunity to talk about time-series analysis and how RS data allows us to do ts analyses. We should introduce them to calculating indices in RS. You can, for the purpose of this exercise, adapt Vini's Planet/RapidEye exercise and have the students play with planet data and compute NDWI for Lake Raleigh and look at a time series of NDWI. We won't have them download the data but we can mention that there is a way for them to get the data themselves.
